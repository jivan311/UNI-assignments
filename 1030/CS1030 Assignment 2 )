4. In Computer technology, what is a bus? What are the three signal groups of a bus?
    The bus is a communication system that allows different components of computer to transfer data, addresses, and control signals.

    The three signal groups of a bus are as follows: 
        1. Address bus: 
            The funciton of address bus is to carry data between the CPU, and  memory.
        2. Data bus: 
            Data bus carries data between the CPU, memory, and the other components of the computer systems.
        
        3. Control bus:
            It carries control signals, such as read and write signals, between the CPU and other system components.
